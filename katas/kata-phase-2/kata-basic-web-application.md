# Basic Web Application Kata

This kata will be enhanced and built upon throughout the second phase of your acceleration. The basic requirements are simple, however there will be a larger focus on building other aspects of your project. 

This kata will be used for your second quorum review, which will not involve looking at any of your code. Instead we will focus on four other key areas of software development: API Design, Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery/Deployment and Security.

## Requirements
You will develop a REST API that offers [CRUD](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-crud) functionality:
- Create a new entry
- Read a list of all existing entries
- Read an existing entry
- Update an existing entry
- Delete an existing entry

The topic of the API is up to you and you can create a standalone API or an API that interacts with other existing APIs.

The learning objectives will guide you through implementing the API. You will end with an API project that:
* Is well documented and uses industry standards
* Automatically tests and builds your project artefacts
* Automatically deploys your project into a production-ready environment
* Has security built-in

## Examples and Ideas
You don't have to pick from the list below, but if you're stuck for ideas here are some options: 

### Standalone APIs
- A Names API that maintains a list of names
- A Booklist API that maintains a list of books
- A Movie API that maintains a list of movies
- A Recipe Book API that maintains a list of recipes
- A Joke API that maintains a list of jokes

### Integrated APIs
- A Playlist API that maintains a list of Spotify/YouTube playlist links
- A Booklist API that maintains a list of books and pulls individual book data from the GoodReads API
- A Movie API that maintains a list of movies and pulls individual movie data from the IMDB API
- A Pokemon API that maintains a list of Pokemon parties and pulls individual Pokemon data from the PokeAPI

## Learning Objectives

Guidance on how to use this kata to achieve your learning objectives is outline in this document:
